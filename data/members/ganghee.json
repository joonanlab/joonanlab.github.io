  "bio_html": "<p>Ganghee has a vested interest in developing a bioinformatics pipeline geared towards the analysis of large-scale whole genome sequencing datasets, with a focus on exploring structural variations within the Korean cohort of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Presently, he is dedicating his efforts towards the investigation of structural variants that are associated with ASD. The primary objective of his research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of genomic architecture of ASD and to identify causal loci for structural variant analyses associated with ASD.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2021-present Ph.D. candidate, Department of Integrated Biomedical and Life Science, Korea University</li>\n<li>2017-2021 B.Sc., Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Publications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kim SW✻, Lee H, Song DY, <strong>Lee GH</strong>, Han JH, Lee JW, Byun HJ, Son JH, Kim YR, Lee Y, Kim E, Werling DM, Kim SH, Sanders SJ, Yoo HJ†, An JY†, Evaluation of familial phenotype deviation to measure the impact of de novo mutations in autism, Genome Medicine, 2025</li>\n<li>Kim JM✻, Cho HW✻, Shin DM, Kim OH, Kim J, Lee H, <strong>Lee GH</strong>, An JY, Yang M, Jo HS, Jang JH, Chang YS, Park HY†, Park MH†, Uncovering Potential Causal Genes for Undiagnosed Congenital Anomalies Using an In-House Pipeline for Trio-Based Whole-Genome Sequencing, Human Genomics, 2025</li>\n<li>Song KJ✻, Choi S✻, Kim K✻, Hwang HS✻, Chang E, Park JS, Shim SB, Choi S, Heo YJ, An WJ, Yang DY, Cho KC, Ji W, Choi CM, Lee JC, Kim HR, Yoo J, Ahn HS, <strong>Lee GH</strong>, Hwa C, Kim S, Kim KG, Kim MS, Paek E, Na S†, Jang SJ†, An JY†, Kim KP†, Proteogenomic Analysis of a Korean Cohort Reveals Lung Cancer Subtypes Predictive of Metastasis, Chromosome Instability, and Tumor Microenvironment, Nature Communications, 2024</li>\n<li>Kim SW✻, Lee H✻, Song DY, <strong>Lee GH</strong>, Ji J, Park JW, Han JH, Lee JW, Byun HJ, Son JH, Kim YR, Lee Y, Kim J, Jung A, Lee JH, Kim EH, Kim SH, Lee JH, Satterstrom FK, Girirajan S, Børglum AD, Grove J, Kim EJ†, Werling DM†, Yoo HJ†, An JY†, Whole genome sequencing analysis identifies sex differences of familial pattern contributing to phenotypic diversity in autism, Genome Medicine, 2024</li>\n<li>Kim JH✻, Koh IG, Lee H, <strong>Lee GH</strong>, Song DY, Kim SW, Kim Y, Han JH, Bong G, Lee J, Byun H, Son JH, Kim YR, Lee Y, Kim JJ, Park JW, Kim IB, Choi JK, Jang JH, Trost B, Lee J, Kim E, Yoo HJ†, An JY†, Short tandem repeat expansions in cortical layer-specific genes implicate in phenotypic severity and adaptability of autism spectrum disorder, Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 2024</li>\n<li>Heo YJ✻, Hwa C, <strong>Lee GH</strong>, Park JM, An JY†, Integrative multi-omics approaches in cancer research: from biological networks to clinical subtypes, Molecules and Cells, 2021</li>\n</ul>",
