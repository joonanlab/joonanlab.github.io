I am particularly interested in exploring how advanced compuational methodologies can contribute to more robust and efficient data analysis and uncovering genetic factors associated with autism. This research aims to deepen our understanding of genetic variation in large cohorts and its implications in neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2018-2024 B.Sc., School of Systems Biomedical Science, Soongsil University, South Korea</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Publications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lee H✻, <strong>Kim WH✻</strong>, Kwon NH✻, Kim CH, Kim SM, An JY†, Lessons from national biobank projects utilizing whole-genome sequencing for population-scale genomics, Genomics &amp; Informatics, 2025</li>\n</ul>"
