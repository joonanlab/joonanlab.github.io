She is primarily interested in developing predictive models for anticancer drug resistance and in biologically interpreting the mechanisms underlying drug response through AI-based virtual cell research. Her work emphasizes the integration of multi-omics data and the application of bio-foundation models. Ultimately, her goal is to develop precision oncology technologies that are applicable to real-world clinical settings.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2021-2026 B.Sc., Biological Sciences, Ajou University</li>\n</ul>"
