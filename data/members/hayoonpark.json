  "bio_html": "<p>Hayoon focuses her research on elucidating the biological characteristics of cancer and the mechanisms underlying therapeutic responses through comprehensive cancer multi-omics analyses. She has a particular interest in proteomics and post-translational modifications, aiming to understand how regulatory events at the protein level contribute to cancer progression and treatment outcomes. By integrating multi-omics data, she aims to uncover key regulatory networks and deepen the understanding of cancer biology to help develop more effective therapeutic strategies.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2022-present B.Sc. in Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Publication</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ryu Y✻, Chang E, <strong>Park H</strong>, Cho S-Y†, An JY†, Proteogenomic Analysis on RNA m6A Modification-Associated Genes Identifies a Distinct Subgroup with High IGF2BPs Expression Across Cancer Types, International Journal of Medical Sciences, 2025</li>\n</ul>"
