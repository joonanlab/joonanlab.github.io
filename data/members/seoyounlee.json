She is particularly interested in leveraging deep learning to predict the disease risk on non-coding variants and in exploring model architectures that can capture biologically meaningful patterns. She hopes to contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional roles of noncoding regions in human disorders.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2023-present B.Sc., Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University</li>\n<li>2023-present B.Sc., Department of Statistics, Korea University</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Undergraduate Scholarship, Dooeul Foundation</li>\n</ul>"
