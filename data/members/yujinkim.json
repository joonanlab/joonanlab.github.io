  "bio_html": "<p>Yujin's primary research interest lies in studying noncoding mutations that disrupt enhancers implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To this end, she is currently analyzing whole-genome sequencing data from a Korean cohort of individuals with ASD, using a range of computational and statistical techniques. Yujin is working to estimate the functional impact of noncoding variants, with a particular emphasis on enhancer activity, and prioritize causal variants that may be associated with ASD.</p>\n<p>Yujin's research builds upon the findings of a previous study by Werling et al. (2018), which introduced the Category-wide Association Study (CWAS) statistical framework to assess the risk of noncoding mutations in whole-genome sequencing data of ASD families. While CWAS remains a key focus of her research efforts, Yujin is also integrating single-cell datasets of brain tissue and chromatin interactions to refine the CWAS methodology further. By studying the impact of noncoding mutations on enhancer activity in the developing prefrontal cortex, Yujin hopes to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of ASD. </p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2021-present Ph.D. candidate, Department of Integrated Biomedical and Life Science, Korea University</li>\n<li>2017-2020 B.A. in Psychology, Korea University</li>\n<li>2017-2020 B.Sc. in Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Publications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kim JP✻, Cho M✻, Kim C✻, Lee H, Jang B, Jung SH, <strong>Kim Y</strong>, Koh IG, Kim S, Shin D, Lee EH, Lee JY, Park YC, Jang H, Kim BH, Ham H, Kim B, Kim Y, Cho AH, Raj T, Kim HJ, Na DL, Seo SW†, An JY†, Won HH†, Whole-genome sequencing analyses suggest novel genetic factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease and a cumulative effects model for risk liability, Nature Communications, 2025</li>\n<li>Kang M✻, Choi J✻, Han J, Araki T, Kim SW, Ryu HH, Kim MG, Kim S, Jang H, Kim SY, Hwang KD, Kim S, Yoo M, Lee J, Kim K, Park P, Choi JE, Han DH, <strong>Kim Y</strong>, Kim J, Chang S, Kaang BK, Ko JM, Cheon KA, An JY, Kim SJ, Park H, Neel BG, Kim CH†, Lee YS†, Aberrant ERK signaling in astrocytes impairs learning and memory in RASopathy-associated BRAF mutant mouse models, Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2025</li>\n<li>An JY†and <strong>Kim YJ</strong>, Genomic patterns in the schizophrenia brain, Science, 2024</li>\n<li><strong>Kim Y✻</strong>, Jeong M✻, Koh IG, Kim C, Lee H, Kim JH, Yurko R, Kim IB, Park J, Werling DM, Sanders SJ, An JY†, CWAS-Plus: Estimating category-wide association of rare noncoding variation from whole-genome sequencing data with cell-type-specific functional data, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 2024</li>\n<li>Park G✻, Jang WE✻, Kim S✻, Gonzales EL, Ji J, Choi S, <strong>Kim Y</strong>, Park JH, Mohammad HB, Bang G, Kang M, Kim SB, Jeon SJ, Kim JY, Kim KP, Shin CY†, An JY†, Kim MS†, Lee YS†, Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via Rnf146 upregulation in a VPA-induced mouse model of autism spectrum disorder, Experimental and Molecular Medicine, 2023</li>\n<li>Yoon K✻, <strong>Kim Y✻</strong>, Kim S✻, Cui Y, Ji J, Choi S, Park G, Chung JH, Lee YS†, An JY†, DH Lee†, Chronic skin ultraviolet irradiation induces transcriptomic changes associated with microglial dysfunction in the hippocampus, Molecular Brain, 2022.</li>\n<li>Kim YG✻, Bak MS, Kim A, <strong>Kim Y</strong>, Chae YC, Kim YL, Chun YS, AN JY, Seo SB, Kim SJ, Lee YS†, Kdm3b haploinsufficiency impairs the consolidation of cerebellum-dependent motor memory in mice, Molecular Brain, 2021.</li>\n<li>Kim SW✻, <strong>Kim YJ✻</strong>, Kim SE†, An JY†, Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Neurodevelopment and Central Nervous System, Biology , 2021</li>\n<li><strong>Kim Y✻</strong>, An JY†, Spatio-temporal roles of ASD-associated variants in human brain development, Genes, 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2024, Outstanding Presentation Award, 2024 International Joint Conference of KSMGG &amp; EAUHGS</li>\n<li>2024, Best Posters Awards, the 32nd International KOGO Annual Conference</li>\n<li>2024 Best Paper Award, Annual Conference of Korean Society for Bioinformatics</li>\n<li>2022 Predoctoral Fellowship, SBS Seoam Yoon Se Young Foundation (2022-2026)</li>\n</ul>"
