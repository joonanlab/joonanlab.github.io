  "bio_html": "<p>Davin Lee investigates cellular interactions and molecular regulatory mechanisms within the neuroimmune system using single-cell RNA sequencing and multi-omics data. His research focuses on autism spectrum disorder, aiming to elucidate how cross-talk among immune cells influences inflammatory responses and neurodevelopmental processes. By analyzing cell type, developmental stage, and sex-specific transcriptional changes at the single-cell level and integrating these findings into a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas, He seeks to advance a comprehensive understanding of neuroimmune mechanisms underlying brain disorders.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2026-present M.Sc., Department of Integrated Biomedical and Life Science, Korea University</li>\n<li>2020-2026 B.Sc., Computer Science and Engineering, Chung-ang University</li>\n<li>2020-2026 B.Sc., Plant Science and Technology, Chung-ang University</li>\n</ul>"
