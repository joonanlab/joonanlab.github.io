He is particularly interested in applying LLMs to study non-coding de novo variants associated with autism spectrum disorder. His current work focuses on predicting the functional impact of these variants and interpreting disease-relevant patterns in the genome, with a growing interest in model explainability to better understand the biological relevance of learned features. Through this work, he hopes to contribute to a deeper understanding of human biology and ultimately advance human health.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2020-present B.Sc. in Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University</li>\n<li>2020-present B.Sc. in Computer Sceience and Engineering, Korea University</li>\n</ul>"
