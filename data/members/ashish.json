  "bio_html": "<p>Ashish is an undergraduate researcher whose interests lie in exploring the relationships between various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders at the genetic level. His reseach, which focuses on common and de novo variants, explores how inherited and spontaneous genetic variation contribute to disorder risk, heterogeneity, and cross-disorder relationships</p>\n<p>His research of common variants uses GWAS data and various statistical approaches to investigate the genetic overlap between disorders and their comorbidities. Meanwhile, his research uses whole-genome sequencing data to investigate the characteristics of the de novo variants that contibute to autism. Through his research, Ashish hopes to further elucidate the genetic etiology of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in the context of other disorders and their comorbidities.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2021-present B.Sc., Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Publications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kim SW†, Lee H†, Song DY, Lee GH, Ji J, Park JW, Han JH, Lee JW, Byun HJ, Son JH, Kim YR, Lee Y, Kim J, <strong>Jung A</strong>, Lee JH, Kim EH, Kim SH, Lee JH, Satterstrom FK, Girirajan S, Børglum AD, Grove J, Kim EJ†, Werling DM†, Yoo HJ†, An JY†, Whole genome sequencing analysis identifies sex differences of familial pattern contributing to phenotypic diversity in autism.
