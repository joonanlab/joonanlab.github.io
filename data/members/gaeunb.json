  "bio_html": "<p>Gaeun Byeon is dedicated to advancing our understanding of cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms within complex tissues through the application of single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptomics data. With a primary focus on organ transplantation and brain circuitry, Gaeun’s current research integrates multi-omic data to examine how specific cellular environments drive functional outcomes. Her interdisciplinary collaborations and multi-dimensional approach enable her to explore both immune and neural systems with a fresh perspective, uncovering insights relevant to both transplant science and neurobiology.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2020-2024 B.Sc., Biomedical Science and Engineering, Konkuk University</li>\n<li>2020-2024 B.Sc., Food Marketing and Technology, Konkuk University</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2025 Best poster award, Annual Conference of Korean Society for Bioinformatics</li>\n</ul>"
