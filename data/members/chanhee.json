  "bio_html": "<p>Chanhee is a graduate student fascinated by unraveling the intricate interactions of biological pathways associated with phenotypes. With a strong interest in neurological disorders, his primary drive is to uncover the underlying biological principles of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. He employs a statistical approach that leverages single-cell data and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to achieve this.</p>\n<p>In his quest to decipher the pathological mechanisms of dementia, his investigations are centered around the meticulous repetition of studies. Through these iterative efforts, he aims to figure out the extent to which genetic factors illuminate the complex phenotype of Alzheimer's. His particular focus lies in dissecting the roles of noncoding regions, especially enhancers and promoters. This involves an ongoing exploration of how mutations within these noncoding regions impact protein transcription. Ultimately, his goal is to enhance the understanding of the genetic foundations that contribute to Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n<p>Currently, Chanhee is focusing on a research aimed at identifying noncoding variants associated with Alzheimer's disease using whole genome sequencing data.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2023-present M.Sc. candidate, Department of Integrated Biomedical and Life Science, Korea University</li>\n<li>2017-2023 B.Sc., School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, South Korea</li>\n<li>2017-2023 B.Sc., Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University, South Korea</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Publication</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kim JP✻, Cho M✻, <strong>Kim C✻</strong>, Lee H, Jang B, Jung SH, Kim Y, Koh IG, Kim S, Shin D, Lee EH, Lee JY, Park YC, Jang H, Kim BH, Ham H, Kim B, Kim Y, Cho AH, Raj T, Kim HJ, Na DL, Seo SW†, An JY†, Won HH†, Whole-genome sequencing analyses suggest novel genetic factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease and a cumulative effects model for risk liability, Nature Communications, 2025</li>\n<li>Kim Y✻, Jeong M✻, Koh IG, <strong>Kim C</strong>, Lee H, Kim JH, Yurko R, Kim IB, Park J, Werling DM, Sanders SJ, An JY†, CWAS-Plus: Estimating category-wide association of rare noncoding variation from whole-genome sequencing data with cell-type-specific functional data, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Awards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2025 Best Poster Award at the 21th KOGO Winter Symposium</li>\n</ul>",
