  "bio_html": "<p>Kyeongho’s research centers on exploring the genetic architecture of dementia through comprehensive whole-genome analyses. He is particularly interested in uncovering how genetic variants within noncoding regions and tandem repeat sequences contribute to the onset and phenotypic diversity of Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, his research focuses on detecting tandem repeat variations associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Through this integrative approach combining genomics, bioinformatics, and neuroscience, Kyeongho aims to broaden our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying dementia. His research seeks to uncover novel genetic markers for early diagnosis and identify potential therapeutic targets, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of neurodegenerative disorders in an aging society.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2026-present M.Sc., Department of Integrated Biomedical and Life Science, Korea University</li>\n<li>2020-2026 B.Sc. in Biosystem and Biomedical Sciences, Korea University</li>\n</ul>"
