By leveraging long-read sequencing data and computational methods, she aims to advance deep learning models to predict variant pathogenicity and gain genomic insights. Her research seeks to improve model interpretability by incorporating biologically meaningful patterns, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying human disorders and diseases.</p>\n<h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2025-present M.Sc. candidate, Department of Integrated Biomedical and Life Science, Korea University</li>\n<li>2020-2025 B.Sc., in Genetics and Biotechnology, Kyunghee University</li>\n<li>2020-2025 B.Sc., in Software Convergence, Kyunghee University</li>\n</ul>"
