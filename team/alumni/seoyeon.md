Seoyeon is interested in leveraging single-cell data and bioinformatics to explore the molecular basis of human neurodevelopment and neurological disorders. To this end, she collaborates with experts in proteomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, applying her computational expertise and passion for neuroscience. 

During her training, Seoyeon initiated the multi-omics analyses to decipher the impact of valproic acid on fetal ASD, revealing RNF146-driven dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (Park et al., 2023). Building on this, she constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the human brain, mapping disorder-risk gene dynamics from 7 gestational weeks to 90 years and identifying a perinatal surge in autism-associated genes within neural progenitors (Kim et al., 2024).

Seoyeon collaborates across disciplines to advance research on neurodevelopment and neurological disorders. As a visiting researcher at Columbia University, she conducted single-cell transcriptomic analyses in Alzheimer’s disease using the ROSMAP cohort and trained lab members in bioinformatics workflows. She is currently exploring how genetic and environmental factors interact to shape brain development, aiming to uncover key principles underlying neurological disorders.
