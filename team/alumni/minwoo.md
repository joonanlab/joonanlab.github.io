  Minwoo's research interest is to develop a software package for accurate, reproducible and scalable analysis of whole genome sequencing data from patients with developmental disorders. Currently, he is mainly focusing on developing a package to perform stringent association tests to find non-coding loci associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using de novo variants from whole genome sequencing data and diverse annotation data sets. His research aims to improve the accuracy of detecting non-coding loci associated with ASD by integrating newly added annotation data sets such as Hi-C and single cell RNA-sequencing data sets and to apply this approach to finding non-coding loci associated with other developmental disorders.
