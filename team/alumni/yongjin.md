  Yongjin is an undergraduate intern working on characterize the co-expression gene network underlying different cancer types and decipher key elements modulating a biological network. He will be joining our graduate program to study transcriptional trajectory in small lung cancer patients from a large clinical cohort and characterize a molecular network across different cancer developmental stages.
