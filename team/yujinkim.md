Yujin is interested in how genetic architecture in complex genomic disorders such as autism spectrum disorder is constructed. She is mainly working on whole-genome sequencing dataset from Korean autism spectrum disorder cohort. Her research focuses on estimating the functional impact of noncoding variants and prioritizing causal variants.
