Yeojin's research mainly focues on the detection and functional identification of noncoding variants using large language models. By leveraging long-read sequencing data and computational methods, she aims to advance deep learning models to predict variant pathogenicity and gain genomic insights. Her research seeks to improve model interpretability by incorporating biologically meaningful patterns, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying human disorders and diseases.
