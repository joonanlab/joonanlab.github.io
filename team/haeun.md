Haeun is dedicated to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that drive heterogeneous drug responses in cancer using integrative multi-omics approaches. Her research combines proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and transcriptomic data to investigate how dysregulation of gene expression and post-translational processes shapes signaling dynamics and influences therapeutic outcomes.

Focusing on the identification of key proteins and phosphorylation events associated with drug sensitivity and resistance, Haeun aims to discover potential therapeutic targets that explain interpatient variability in treatment response. By leveraging multi-omics integration, she seeks to pinpoint critical molecular features that contribute to resistance against targeted therapies and to validate their clinical relevance.

Ultimately, her research translates complex omics data into actionable biological insights, advancing the development of more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies in precision oncology.
