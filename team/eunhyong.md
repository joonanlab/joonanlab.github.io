Eunhyongâ€™s research interest is to delineate the biological mechanisms underlying cancer biology by dealing with multi-omics data. Since copy number variation is excessively common in all types of cancer, she mainly focuses on deciphering copy number variation and mutational signatures to classify the tumor samples and specify their etiology. Her research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous mutational processes of human cancer.
