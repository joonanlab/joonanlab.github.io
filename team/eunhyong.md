Eunhyongâ€™s research interest is to delineate the biological mechanisms underlying cancer biology by dealing with multi-omics data. Since chromosomal aneuploidy is excessively common in all types of cancer, she mainly focuses on deciphering cancer subtypes that represent whole genome doubling (WGD) features and elucidating the kinase network of these subtypes. Her research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous mutational and biological processes that lead to WGD in human cancer.
