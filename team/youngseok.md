Youngseok is interested in applying AI and bioinformatics to uncover the biological processes underlying neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Currently, Young Seok is working on a research project that aims to explain the biological mechanisms behind ASD by leveraging single-cell transcriptome data and deep learning frameworks.
