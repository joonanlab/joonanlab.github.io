Ingyeong is a graduate student with a strong interest in constructing large scale brain single-cell atlases and exploring the characteristics of diverse brain cell types. Her research focuses on uncovering the biological mechanisms and specific cell types involved in the causes of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. By identifying and analyzing the brain cell populations associated with these diseases, she aims to gain a deeper understanding of the complex cellular interactions and biological processes that drive these conditions.

In particular, she investigates the roles of neurons and glial cells, examining how their interactions contribute to the onset and progression of neurological disorders. She is keen to expand her expertise in advanced analytical techniques about integrating cutting-edge approaches, such as brain organoids and deep learning technologies, to uncover cell type-specific patterns and biomarkers across multiple omics datasets. Through her research, Ingyeong aims to contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for brain disorders.
