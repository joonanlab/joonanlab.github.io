Heesun’s research focuses on AI-driven analysis of human cancer multi-omics data. She is primarily interested in developing predictive models for anticancer drug resistance and in biologically interpreting the mechanisms underlying drug response through AI-based virtual cell research. Her work emphasizes the integration of multi-omics data and the application of bio-foundation models. Ultimately, her goal is to develop precision oncology technologies that are applicable to real-world clinical settings.
