Wooheon's research interests focus on the technical aspects of large-scale whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies in autism. I am particularly interested in exploring how advanced compuational methodologies can contribute to more robust and efficient data analysis and uncovering genetic factors associated with autism. This research aims to deepen our understanding of genetic variation in large cohorts and its implications in neurodevelopmental conditions.
