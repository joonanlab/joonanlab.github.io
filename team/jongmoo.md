Jongmoo is committed to the identification and investigation of novel genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and rare diseases, with a particular focus on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and their biological impact.

Currently, he is working on a research project focused on the detection and analysis of de novo variants using long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from Korean families affected by ASD.

He aims to contribute to the advancement of this field by leveraging bioinformatics approaches, including WGS analysis and AI-driven methods, to decode complex genetic architectures.
