Gijong is an Undergraduate intern working on the estimation of the tumor microenvironment of lung cancer from patient-derived RNA sequencing data. In this lab, he focuses on various transcriptome analysis to study tumor microenvironment underlying various cancers. By doing these works, he is aiming to understand how next-generation sequencing skills and preprocessing works and the direction of the multi-omics project in refractory cancer research. Also, he will try to link the current subject of the multi-omics project through the tumor microenvironment analysis tool.
