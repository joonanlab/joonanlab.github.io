Beomsu is an undergraduate intern interested in elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders using genome-wide sequencing data.
His research primarily focuses on long-read whole-genome sequencing to resolve complex and previously inaccessible genomic regions, including structural variation and epigenetic features such as DNA methylation. He also leverages short-read sequencing data as a resource to enhance variant detection and interpretation.
To analyze these data, Beomsu applies statistical frameworks for rare variant analysis, including TADA and BurdenEM, to large-scale genomic datasets. Building on this analytical experience, he is interested in refining existing methodologies and exploring the development of computational tools tailored to long-read sequencing and other emerging genomic technologies.
