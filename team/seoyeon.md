Seoyeon is interested in leveraging sequencing data and bioinformatics to understand the molecular basis of human genomics. To this end, she actively collaborates with proteomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics experts, employing her own statistical and computational techniques. 

During her training, Seoyeon initiated the analysis of transcriptomics data to elucidate the fundamental interactions of inflammatory bone marrow cells. She led collaboration with various experts and solidified her framework in interpreting immune biology using sequencing data. Expanding beyond immunology, she has applied her insights to decipher the impact of valproic acid on the manifestation of fetal ASD, as demonstrated in her work (Park et al., 2023).

Seoyeon is actively engaged in collaborations across diverse fields of single-cell data, with a specific emphasis on the immune and nervous systems. Her current research explores dynamic changes in transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles during neurodevelopment through large-scale integration of single-cell data.
