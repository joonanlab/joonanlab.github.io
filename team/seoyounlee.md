Seoyoun's research interests lie in the use of genomic language models to investigate non-coding variants in the human genome. She is particularly interested in leveraging deep learning to predict the disease risk on non-coding variants and in exploring model architectures that can capture biologically meaningful patterns. She hopes to contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional roles of noncoding regions in human disorders.
