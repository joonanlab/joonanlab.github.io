Gaeun Byeon is dedicated to advancing our understanding of cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms within complex tissues through the application of single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptomics data. With a primary focus on organ transplantation and brain circuitry, Gaeunâ€™s current research integrates multi-omic data to examine how specific cellular environments drive functional outcomes. Her interdisciplinary collaborations and multi-dimensional approach enable her to explore both immune and neural systems with a fresh perspective, uncovering insights relevant to both transplant science and neurobiology.
