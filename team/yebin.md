Yebin is an Undergraduate intern interested in exploring gene expression and transcriptional profile of brain cells at single cell resolution. She is working on using ATAC-seq to understand specific transcriptional changes occurring in brain cells throughout the developmental processes. She is also interested in deep learning model to predict regulatory activities and expression patterns from genetic sequences. Through understanding the model and single cell technology, she aims to shed light on the impact of non-coding mutations in neurological disorders.
