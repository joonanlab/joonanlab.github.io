Dong-Min completed his Master's degree in a wet lab focused on the molecular biology of Arabidopsis aging. It was during the process of acquiring data to validate his hypotheses that he first recognized the transformative potential of bioinformatics. To gain practical experience, he joined a bioinformatics firm, where he became proficient in analyzing various datasets generated via NGS technologies. Based on this foundation, he is now driven to study the mechanisms of neurodevelopment. He is particularly keen on utilizing cutting-edge technologies—such as scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, deep learning, and organoids—to overcome historical research barriers and elucidate the complexities of the nervous system.
