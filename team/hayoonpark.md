Hayoon focuses her research on elucidating the biological characteristics of cancer and the mechanisms underlying therapeutic responses through comprehensive cancer multi-omics analyses. She has a particular interest in proteomics and post-translational modifications, aiming to understand how regulatory events at the protein level contribute to cancer progression and treatment outcomes. By integrating multi-omics data, she aims to uncover key regulatory networks and deepen the understanding of cancer biology to help develop more effective therapeutic strategies.
