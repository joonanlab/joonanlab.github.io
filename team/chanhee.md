Chanhee is a graduate student fascinated by unraveling the intricate interactions of biological pathways associated with phenotypes. With a strong interest in neurological disorders, his primary drive is to uncover the underlying biological principles of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. He employs a statistical approach that leverages single-cell data and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to achieve this.

In his quest to decipher the pathological mechanisms of dementia, his investigations are centered around the meticulous repetition of studies. Through these iterative efforts, he aims to figure out the extent to which genetic factors illuminate the complex phenotype of Alzheimer's. His particular focus lies in dissecting the roles of noncoding regions, especially enhancers and promoters. This involves an ongoing exploration of how mutations within these noncoding regions impact protein transcription. Ultimately, his goal is to enhance the understanding of the genetic foundations that contribute to Alzheimer's disease.

Currently, Chanhee is focusing on a research aimed at identifying noncoding variants associated with Alzheimer's disease using whole genome sequencing data.
