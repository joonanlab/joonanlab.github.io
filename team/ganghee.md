  Ganghee is interested in developing a pipeline for and exploring large scale whole genome and exome sequencing datasets from Korean autism spectrum disorder cohorts. He is currently working on exploring genomic data to discover rare structural variants including short tandem repeats or copy number variants. His aim is to understand genomic architecture and to find causative susceptibility loci through various kinds of structural variant studies in developmental disorders.
