Ganghee has a vested interest in developing a bioinformatics pipeline geared towards the analysis of large-scale whole genome sequencing datasets, with a focus on exploring structural variations within the Korean cohort of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Presently, he is dedicating his efforts towards the investigation of structural variants that are associated with ASD. The primary objective of his research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of genomic architecture of ASD and to identify causal loci for structural variant analyses associated with ASD.
