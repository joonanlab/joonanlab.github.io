Jungeun is a master's student with a strong interest in the biological mechanisms of the brain and the disorders that affect it. Her research is focused on identifying transcriptional systems involved in the processes of learning and memory using single-cell spatial sequencing technology. By leveraging this cutting-edge technology, Jungeun aims to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie memory formation with high spatial specificity.

Jungeun's research specifically targets the transcriptional systems of the brain responsible for the acquisition and retention of memories at the single-cell level. She aims to map the neural circuits involved in the formation of memories by studying the activity of individual neurons at a high resolution and examining the molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression in the brain. By investigating the transcriptional and cellular-level mechanisms involved in learning and memory, Jungeun hopes to provide a more detailed understanding of the neural processes that underlie memory formation, and to contribute to the development of new treatments for memory-related disorders.

In summary, Jungeun's research employs single-cell spatial sequencing technology to elucidate the transcriptional systems that underlie the mechanisms of learning and memory. Her research has the potential to advance our understanding of the neural processes that are critical for memory formation with high spatial specificity, and to provide new avenues for the development of therapeutic interventions for memory-related disorders.nner.
