Davin Lee investigates cellular interactions and molecular regulatory mechanisms within the neuroimmune system using single-cell RNA sequencing and multi-omics data. His research focuses on autism spectrum disorder, aiming to elucidate how cross-talk among immune cells influences inflammatory responses and neurodevelopmental processes. By analyzing cell type, developmental stage, and sex-specific transcriptional changes at the single-cell level and integrating these findings into a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas, He seeks to advance a comprehensive understanding of neuroimmune mechanisms underlying brain disorders.
