Dr. An is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biosystem and Biomedical Science at Korea University.

He is a human geneticist whose research focuses on the genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental conditions. His group investigates how genetic variants contribute to the etiology and phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD through large-scale whole-genome sequencing and multi-omics integration. The team combines population-scale genomics with single-cell and epigenomic resources to delineate the cell-type and temporal specificity of neuropsychiatric risk genes and to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development.

Dr. An’s research advances cross-ancestry genetic discovery by integrating Korean ASD cohorts with international datasets, expanding the understanding of ASD beyond European-centric studies. His laboratory also develops computational frameworks for noncoding variant association and applies integrative analyses of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data to connect genetic variation with neural function and clinical outcomes.
