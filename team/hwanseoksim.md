Hwanseok's research bridges deep learning and genomics to investigate the genetic architecture of human diseases. He is particularly interested in applying LLMs to study non-coding de novo variants associated with autism spectrum disorder. His current work focuses on predicting the functional impact of these variants and interpreting disease-relevant patterns in the genome, with a growing interest in model explainability to better understand the biological relevance of learned features. Through this work, he hopes to contribute to a deeper understanding of human biology and ultimately advance human health.
