Seojin is an undergraduate intern interested in single-cell analysis of neuronal cells and spatial profiling of brain images. Currently, she is utilizing scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data to explore the transcriptional mechanisms related to fear learning and memory within the brain. Through her research using single-cell spatial sequencing technologies, Seojin aims to delve into the neural and cellular processes underlying memory formation. Her research may offer a deeper understanding of individual neurons in fear-memory processes, contributing valuable insights to the development of therapeutic approaches for memory and fear-related brain disorders.
