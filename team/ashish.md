Ashish is an undergraduate researcher whose interests lie in exploring the relationships between various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders at the genetic level. His reseach, which focuses on common and de novo variants, explores how inherited and spontaneous genetic variation contribute to disorder risk, heterogeneity, and cross-disorder relationships

His research of common variants uses GWAS data and various statistical approaches to investigate the genetic overlap between disorders and their comorbidities. Meanwhile, his research uses whole-genome sequencing data to investigate the characteristics of the de novo variants that contibute to autism. Through his research, Ashish hopes to further elucidate the genetic etiology of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in the context of other disorders and their comorbidities.
