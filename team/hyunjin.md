Hyunjin's research focuses on elucidating the human genetic architecture through whole-genome data analysis. She is currently performing long-read whole-genome sequencing analyses of Korean autism family cohorts, with the goal of identifying genetic factors that contribute to autism.
Her work places a particular emphasis on leveraging long-read sequencing technologies to resolve complex genomic regions—such as repetitive elements and structural variants—that are challenging to capture with short-read data.
