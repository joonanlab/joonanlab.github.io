The Korean Autism Research Consortium (K-ARC) is a collaborative initiative led by Dr. Hee Jeong Yoo at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, bringing together leading researchers to advance autism spectrum disorder research through comprehensive genomic and multi-omics approaches. The consortium includes Drs. Eunjoon Kim (IBS) and Joon-Yong An (Korea University) for genomics analysis, clinicians Drs. Il Bin Kim, So Hyun Kim, Mi Ae Oh, and Jae Hyun Han for clinical assessment, Drs. Yong-Seok Lee and Dae-Ki Lee for animal model studies, and Drs. Jae Sang Kim, Woong Sun, and Ji Yeon Lee for organoid research. Additional collaborators include Drs. Min-Sik Kim (DGIST), Jun Kim (Chungnam National University), Hong-Hee Won (Sungkyunkwan University), and Woo-Jae Myung (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital).

K-ARC has established one of the largest autism whole-genome sequencing cohorts of East Asian ancestry, with over 2,000 Korean families, enabling groundbreaking discoveries in genetic architecture, sex differences, and noncoding variant associations. Recent publications include the development of CWAS-Plus for identifying noncoding variant associations (*Briefings in Bioinformatics*, 2024), comprehensive analysis of sex differences and familial patterns (*Genome Medicine*, 2024), identification of short tandem repeat expansions in cortical layer-specific genes (*Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences*, 2024), and investigation of chromatin interaction disruption and phenotypic outcomes (*Genome Medicine*, 2025). The consortium maintains active international collaborations with the Sanders Lab at Oxford, Werling Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison, Brett Trost and Stephen Scherer at SickKids Hospital, and Anders D. BÃ¸rglum and Jakob Grove at iPSYCH, Aarhus University, Denmark.
