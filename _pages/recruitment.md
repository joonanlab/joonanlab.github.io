## Postdoctoral researchers

We have more data and research ideas than trainees, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:

- Whole genome sequencing analysis and/or genome-wide association study for neurodevelopmental disorders or complex diseases
- Single cell transcriptomics

If you are interested, please contact Dr. An (joonanlab at gmail dot com) directly.

## Graduate students

If you are interested in PhD or MS-PhD courses in our lab, please send a merged PDF of your cover letter, CV and academic record (transcript) of your undergraduate to Dr. An (joonanlab at gmail dot com).
