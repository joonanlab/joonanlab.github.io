## Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the An Lab.

### Postdoctoral researchers

We have more data and research ideas than trainees, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:

- Whole genome sequencing analysis of autism spectrum disorders
- Systems biology and bioinformatics analyses on cancer and/or immune genomics 

If you are interested, please contact Dr. An (joonanlab at gmail dot com) directly.

### Graduate students

Dr. An is a member of [the Integrated Biomedical and Life Science Program](https://chs.korea.ac.kr/chs/grad/lifefusion_1.do). If you are interested in our work, please send Dr. An (joonanlab at gmail dot com) a brief email with a description of your interests, and your CV.

### Undergraduate students
