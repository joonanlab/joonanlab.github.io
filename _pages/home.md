# Welcome to An Lab at Korea University

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/logopic/anlab.png" style="width: 100px; float: left;margin-right: 20px; border: 10px">

We are a computational genomics lab studying the etiology of developmental disorders and complex human diseases using high-dimensional genomic data. Our lab utilises a range of genomics and systems biology approaches to better understand regulatory features and cellular trajectory underlying disease risk. 

We focus on:

- Understanding rare mutations associated with developmental disorders and rare diseases.
- Leveraging single cell RNA sequencing to understand neurodevelopment and disorders.
- Integrating epigenome and transcriptome data to better understand genetic heterogeneity in human disorders.

### Technologies and methods
The An Lab is primarily a computational biology group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including: **whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing, epigenome sequencing, and cloud computing**.

### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [Sanders Lab](http://sanderslab.ucsf.edu) at UCSF, the [Cristino Lab](https://www.tri.edu.au/staff/alex-cristino) at Translational Research Institute, Australia, and the [Autism Sequencing Consortium](https://genome.emory.edu/ASC/).

### Joining An Lab

### Funding
We are grateful for funding from the [National Research Foundation of Korea](http://www.nrf.re.kr/index/).
