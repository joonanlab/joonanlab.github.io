We are a computational genomics lab studying the etiology of developmental disorders and complex human diseases using high-dimensional genomic data. Our lab utilises a range of genomics and systems biology approaches to better understand regulatory features and cellular trajectory underlying disease development. 

We focus on:

- Understanding the genetic architecture of autism.
- Leveraging whole genome sequencing (WGS) and single cell analyses to understand neurodevelopment and disorders.
- Integrating multiomics data to better understand genetic heterogeneity in human disorders.

### Technologies and methods
The An Lab is a computational biology research group specializing in advanced genomic analysis and AI-driven modeling. Our work focuses on **long-read whole-genome sequencing, multi-omics integration, and cloud computing for large-scale data processing**. We are also developing **LLM-based deep learning models to enhance genomic data interpretation and analysis**.

### Collaborators

**Korean Autism Research Consortium (KARC)**

Our team is a part of the [Korean autism research consortium (KARC)](/karc) and closely collaborates with Prof. Hee Jeong Yoo at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, who leads the consortium.

**International Collaborations**

We work closely with international collaborators, including:
- Stephan Sanders at Oxford
- Donna Werling at University of Wisconsin-Madison
- Stephen Scherer and Brett Trost at SickKids Hospital
- Anders D. BÃ¸rglum and Jakob Grove at iPSYCH, Aarhus, Denmark
