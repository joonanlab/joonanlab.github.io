# Welcome to An Lab at Korea University

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/logopic/anlab.png" style="width: 100px; float: left;margin-right: 20px; border: 10px">

We are a computational genomics lab studying the etiology of developmental disorders and complex human diseases using high-dimensional genomic data. Our lab utilises a range of genomics and systems biology approaches to better understand regulatory features and cellular trajectory underlying disease development. 

We focus on:

- Understanding the genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder.
- Leveraging whole genome sequencing (WGS) and single cell analyses to understand neurodevelopment and disorders.
- Integrating multiomics data to better understand genetic heterogeneity in human disorders.

### Technologies and methods
The An Lab is primarily a computational biology group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including: **whole-genome sequencing, single cell RNA/ATAC-seq, multi-omics, and cloud computing**.

### Collaborators
We work with closely with international collaborators, including the [Sanders Lab](http://sanderslab.ucsf.edu) at Oxford, the [Werling lab](https://werling.genetics.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the [Minah Kim Lab](https://www.pathology.columbia.edu/research-labs/kim-lab) at Columbia University. Our team is a part of the Korean ASD WGS consortium and closely collaborates with [Prof. Hee Jeong Yoo](https://www.snubh.org/medical/drIntroduce.do?sDpCd=NP&sDpCdDtl=NP&sDrSid=1000643&sDrStfNo=00978&sDpTp=) at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.
