## Understanding the noncoding genome in neurodevelopmental disorders
<div style="text-align: justify">
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized our ability to find risk mutations in noncoding genome associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dr. An, working in Dr. Sanders' lab at UCSF and Autism Sequence Consortium, provides the clearest evidence of noncoding ASD association came from mutations at evolutionarily conserved nucleotides in the gene promoter region ([An et al. Science 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495306)). We analyzed WGS data of 1,902 quartet families (7,608 individuals) from the Simons Simplex Collection and Korean ASD cohort. We applied two robust methods â€“ a category-wide association study (CWAS) and de novo risk score method ([Werling et al. Nature Genetics]()) - to estimate the contribution of noncoding mutations across multiple biological hypotheses of the noncoding genome. We continue to improve our WGS methods to identify risk noncoding mutations associated with human disorders.

## Deciphering gene pleiotropy across rare and developmental disorders
<div style="text-align: justify">
Pleiotropy is the well-established phenomenon of a single gene affecting multiple traits and disorders. One example is SCN2A, a sodium channel gene strongly associated with both autism and epilepsy. Our systematic survey generated a hypothesis that the distribution of missense mutations in the protein structure determines a phenotypic consequence. This then became a testable hypothesis to our collaborator, performing an electrophysiology experiment to show an opposite mutational consequence of SCN2A in ASD and epilepsy ([Ben-Shalom et al.2017]()). We continue to search for functional convergence and specificity of candidate genes with pleiotropy in human disorders. In particular, we have been collaborating with Drs. [Jong-hee Chae](http://www.snuh.org/global/en/blog/00944/career.do?dr_cd=00944), [Murim Choi](https://www.snugenomics.com/) and [Jaeho Jeong](http://www.snuh.org/global/en/blog/01134/career.do?dr_cd=01134) at Seoul National University Hospital to find gene pleitropy underlying rare developmental disorders.

## Searching for functional convergence underlying autism spectrum disorder
<div style="text-align: justify">
Although gene discovery in neurological disorders has been proceeded rapidly, a major challenge lies in understanding convergence of risk genes across time and space. My long research interest was the genetic comorbidity of risk gene and its gene family for neurodevelopmental disorders ([An and Claudianos 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317861)). Applying our systems biology method to decipher a cohesive biological network across neuropsychiatric disorders ([Cristino et al.2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439483)), we analyzed the genetic screening data of the Australian cohort of ASD to identify risk genetic mutations associated with the disease ([An et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893065), [Williams et al.2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29703944)). In collaboration with Drs. [Yong-Seok Lee](http://www.brain.snu.ac.kr/) and [Hee-Jeong Yoo at Seoul National University](http://medicine.snu.ac.kr/ko/node/12681) and [Minsik Kim at DGIST](https://sites.google.com/view/bio-mass-spec/), our lab is exploring genetic risk factors in Korean ASD cohort and a wide range of animal models to validate common ASD pathophysiology.

## Systems biology approaches to understand cancer biology
<div style="text-align: justify">
Systems biology is a data-driven science that analyzes a large amount of high-dimensional datasets at multiple levels and scales to comprehend the complexity of the cell and its environment. It can provide an unbiased framework to characterize biological phenomena or a model to test a hypothesis from various datasets. Our lab has extended our systems approaches to understand the core of cancer biology and its pathophysiological features in oncogenesis and tumour progression. We are working on a large-scale multi-omics project for the Korean Lung Cancer cohort, a part of precision medicine research program funded by National Research Foundation of Korea. In collaboration with Drs. [Eunok Paek at Hanyang University](http://bislab.hanyang.ac.kr/), [Kwon-Il Kim](https://www.sysbioinfo.com/), [Kwang-Pyo Kim at Kyunghee University](http://fsb.khu.ac.kr/), [Minsik Kim at DGIST](https://sites.google.com/view/bio-mass-spec/), and [Sejin Jang at Asan Medical Center](http://www.amc.seoul.kr/asan/staff/base/staffBaseInfoDetail.do?drEmpId=bnF3LzRhZzZVeE9EN3Z1N3lXL3g1QT09), our lab is developing an integrative framework to analyze multi-omics cancer datasets, ultimately providing an effective predictive model to validate newly-developed therapies and drugs.
