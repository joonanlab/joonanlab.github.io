## Genetic architecture of autism

<div style="text-align: justify">
The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has had a profound impact on the field of translational research, with human genetics being a prime example. It is now possible to examine human patient genomes at the nucleotide level to identify mutations linked to diseases with unprecedented ease. My research focus is centered on understanding the genetic heterogeneity underlying autism ([Choi & An 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763421002700)). As a member of the genomic consortium for autism, I have analyzed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 2,000 quartet families with autism, evaluating the mutation burden in the noncoding genome and its contribution to autism ([An et al. 2018](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aat6576)). Since establishing my research group in Korea, we have been exploring the complete genetic architecture of Korean autism families. Our lab is examining a broad range of genetic factors, including common, rare, and de novo variants, in individuals diagnosed with autism from Korean families.

## Deep learning for regulatory patterns in neurodevelopmental disorder

<div style="text-align: justify">
Our lab uses advanced deep learning techniques, including large language models, to study noncoding regulatory mutations associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We've developed the CWAS framework ([Kim et al. 2024](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/25/4/bbae323/7706421)) to analyze whole genome sequencing data from autism families. Currently, we're integrating single-cell multiomics datasets from developing human brains to further refine our approach. By combining computational methods with rich genomic and epigenomic data, we aim to uncover how noncoding mutations contribute to neurodevelopmental risk. Our work continues to evolve as we improve our models and extend our research to cover more neurodevelopmental conditions. Through these efforts, we strive to develop more accurate diagnostic tools and biomarkers for autism and related disorders, potentially improving early detection and intervention strategies.

## Integrative multi-omics approaches to understand complex disorder

<div style="text-align: justify">
My research focus is centered on exploring the extreme genetic heterogeneity that underlies complex human disorder. I have examined the hypothesis that multiple risk genes converge on a reduced number of crucial biological processes. To this end, I have developed a computational prediction model to identify cohesive biological networks in autism ([An et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/tp201438)). Further integration of this model with in vitro functional characterization has led to the identification of key pathways, including axonal guidance and the NRXN complex, in autism, which were evaluated through functional validation ([Williams et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0049-x)). Our lab has integrated large-scale whole-genome sequencing and transcriptomics datasets of human post-mortem cortex across fetal to adult stages to analyze the impact of genetic variation on gene expression in developing cortex ([Werling et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720303673)). Furthermore, we have applied our systems approach to understand the core of pathology and to identify cancer subtypes and tumor progression, as outlined in [Heo et al. 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8334347/). Multi-omics analysis, particularly through large-scale proteomics, is an emerging area in biomedical science and holds great promise for mechanism and translational research. To that end, our lab has been developing analytical frameworks for multi-omics analysis of Korean lung cancer patients, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, phospho-proteomics, and acetyl-proteomics, to characterize cancer subtypes and tumor microenvironment.
